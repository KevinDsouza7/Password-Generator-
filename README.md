Password Generator
Welcome to the Simple Password Generator! This is a basic web application that helps you create strong passwords easily.

How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

On the page, you'll see a button that says "Generate Password." Click on it.

You'll get a series of questions asking you about the password you want:

How long do you want your password to be? (Pick a number between 8 and 128)
Do you want lowercase letters in your password? (Click OK for yes or Cancel for no)
Do you want uppercase letters in your password? (Click OK for yes or Cancel for no)
Do you want numbers in your password? (Click OK for yes or Cancel for no)
Do you want special characters (like @ or $) in your password? (Click OK for yes or Cancel for no)
Based on your answers, the password generator will create a secure password for you.

You'll see your new password on the page! You can use this password for your accounts to keep them safe.
